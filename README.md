Our project focuses on applying computer vision to facial emotion recognition, with a specific emphasis on utilizing action units to predict emotions and also the intensity values of the recognized. Common practice in this context involves training models using extensive datasets or employing pre-trained models on large datasets. In our case, the approach is centered around facial recognition through action units, aiming to predict the intensity values associated with the identified emotions in images.
